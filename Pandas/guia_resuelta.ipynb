Por otro lado cuenta con información que fue extrayendo a partir de scrapping durante el último año en el formato (timestamp, source, vehicle_model_id, price). La información puede venir de múltiples fuentes (source), que pueden ser por ejemplo distintos sitios de marketplace o clasificados. Luego de un intenso trabajo previo ha podido unificar los modelos de vehículos que utiliza para sus transacciones con la información que ha podido obtener de otros competidores mediante scrapping.

Asimismo en volume se indica el volumen operado ese día para esa acción. Por otro lado se cuenta con el archivo s&p500.csv de formato (symbol, company_name) que indica aquellas acciones que deben ser consideradas para calcular el índice Standard & Poor’s 500 (S&P 500). \n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"j9NGwO-DKpd4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1619458730830,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":1141,"user":{"displayName":"Ezequiel Vilardo","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Ghhu9RLf9mfJtK55_AS1W-u203Q2NgIpuLx2zERVg=s64","userId":"10862837541934202760"}}},"source":["#"],"execution_count":258,"outputs":[]}]}
